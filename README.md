# Bracket Validator

### Description
This project validates whether a string of brackets ((), {}, []) is correctly balanced. It uses a **stack data structure** and demonstrates both procedural and object-oriented programming approaches.

---

### Features
- ✅ Validates parentheses `()`
- ✅ Validates curly braces `{}`
- ✅ Validates square brackets `[]`
- ✅ Returns True/False depending on balance
- ✅ Demonstrates **refactoring from procedural functions to OOP**

---

### File Structure
- `logic_version.py` → First version, focuses on solving the problem with functions and a stack.
- `oop_version.py` → Refactored version, encapsulated in a class (`BracketValidator`) to demonstrate OOP principles.

---

### Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Data Structures: Stack (Python list)
- Concepts: OOP, Encapsulation, Algorithmic Problem Solving
